<!-- investigate the relationship between the belief and desire relations expressed by certain verbs and those verbs' tendency to license negation-raising and veridicality inferences. To do this, we collect a preliminary pilot dataset of human judgements on a natural language inference (NLI) task designed to target the belief and desire properties of different English verbs. We then train an LSTM-based neural NLI model with RoBERTa subword embeddings on existing datasets of negation-raising and veridicality inference judgments and evaluate its ability to correctly make the inferences in the new task. Our initial findings, based only on the small set of judgments from this pilot (fewer than 100 examples), are inconclusive. -->

The **Neg-Raising and Veridicality Project**, which is being carried out as part of the [NRT DESE](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/graduate/nrt.html) program and sponsored by [Professor Aaron White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io), aims to carry out an empirical analysis of neg-raising and veridical inferences, and how the occurrences of these sorts of inferences may be related to belief/desire components of various predicates. Specifically, this project has three primary goals:

1. Collecting large-scale data on belief/desire components of predicates in negative/positive contexts, using human acceptability judgments, to determine which components are foregrounded or backgrounded.

2. Developing a scalable model for analyizing this data, to gain empirical insight on theoretical proposals in the linguistics literature regarding neg-raising and veridical inferences and relationships to syntactic acceptability judgments.

3. Extending the [MegaNegRaising](http://megaattitude.io/projects/mega-negraising/) dataset to include data on semi-neg-raising behavior (e.g. "I don't know that John left" -> "I think that John didn't leave") using human acceptability judgments.
