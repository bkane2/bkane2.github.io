The **MegaAttitude Project**, which is joint work between the [FACTS.lab](http://factslab.io) at the University of Rochester and the [Semantics Lab](http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/rawlins/semantics-lab/) at Johns Hopkins University, has two main goals:

1. Collecting lexicon-scale annotations of the syntactic and semantic properties of clause-embedding verbs, adjectives, and nouns, using human acceptability, veridicality, and similarity judgments.
2. Developing scalable models for analyzing these data inspired by theoretical proposals from the syntax and semantics literature.

MegaAttitude is supported by a National Science Foundation collaborative grant ([BCS-1748969](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1748969&HistoricalAwards=false)/[BCS-1749025](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1749025&HistoricalAwards=false)), and all data generated by the project is freely available for research purposes [here]({{ site.url }}/data/).
