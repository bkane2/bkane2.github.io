          and the sorts of neg-raising and veridical inferences that can be generated."

The **Neg-Raising and Veridicality Project**, which is being carried out as part of the [NRT DESE](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/graduate/nrt.html) program and sponsored by [Professor Aaron White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io), aims to carry out an empirical analysis of neg-raising inferences, and how the occurrences of these sorts of inferences may be related to the veridicality of certain predicates. Specifically, this project has two main goals:

1. Extending the [MegaNegRaising](http://megaattitude.io/projects/mega-negraising/) dataset to include data on semi-neg-raising behavior (e.g. "I don't know that John left" -> "I think that John didn't leave") using human acceptability judgments.

2. Developing a scalable model for analyizing this data, to gain empirical insight on theoretical proposals in the linguistics literature regarding neg-raising and veridical inferences.
